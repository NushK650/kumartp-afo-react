Description:  Rebuild your All For One Project in React
Peer review: Hassan Sajid - Everything looks good. For your reverse numbers though, it does not accept the number 0. Also for your MadLib, it would be nice to have text over the inputs giving the user more information on what they can input so the story can make sense. Other than that, good job!
